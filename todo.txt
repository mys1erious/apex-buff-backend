Todo:
-. Main thing: OPTIMIZE QUERIES (473 queries, 122ms on weapons ROFL):D
-. Make basic endpoint for user stats data
-. Make data seed more scalable
-. Make a single APIView where u can POST a whole Legend in 1 request


Notes:
-- Think that Modificator and RangeStat tables is an inefficient solution,
    but the other 1 I can think of is adding all those Modificators as fields to each table,
    that also seems inefficient ? in free time get deeper into db design to come up with better solution
